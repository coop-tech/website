<h2>Who are we?</h2>

<p>Co-operative Technologists (aka CoTech) is a network of worker co-operatives that sell tech/digital services.The network was founded at an event on 14th November 2016 at Wortley Hall – the worker’s stately home – where many of us met for the very first time to share ideas, skills and plans for world domination.
Each member of the network is a company that is owned and democratically run by its workers (and, in some cases, customers). There are no private shareholders who take money out of the company and/or direct the company’s activities. While many of the member co-operatives do not have completely flat structures – many have boards, management committees, etc. – they are all democratic workplaces and the members have the opportunity to appoint people to roles or change the structure of their organisations.</p>

<h2>Who is eligible to join?</h2>

<p>There is no fee to join CoTech, but, in order to be eligible, your co-operative must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>agree with and practise the 7 Co-operative Principles,</li>
  <li>be owned and democratically run by its workers,</li>
  <li>provide tech/digital services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your membership is approved by the existing members of CoTech via a proposal on Loomio.</p>

<h2>What are your obligations as a member?</h2>

<p>As a member of CoTech, you are obliged to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>be an active participant in the network and its activities,</li>
  <li>finance at least one representative to attend the AGM (currently at Wortley Hall in November).</li>
</ul>

<h2>How do we make decisions?</h2>

<p>The network currently makes decisions using a consensus process on Loomio - an online decision making tool. The process for this is:<p>
<ul>
  <li>a proposal is created on Loomio with a deadline of at least one week,</li>
  <li>votes are cast on a one coop, one vote basis,</li>
  <li>the proposal passes if there are no 'disagree' or 'block' votes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What constitutes a member decision?</h2>

<p>This process is used for member decisions, which are those that have a material impact on CoTech or its members, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>approving new members,</li>
  <li>changing the constitution or manifesto,</li>
  <li>changes to the criteria for membership,</li>
</ul>

<p>Members are encouraged to use this process if they feel it's important to get input or buy-in from the network before proceeding with a certain CoTech activity.</p>
